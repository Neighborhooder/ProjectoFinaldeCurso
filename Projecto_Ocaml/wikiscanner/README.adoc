= Wikiscanner

uses the OCamlGraph library to search a path between two given pages' titles.

== How to compile

A Makefile is included in the distribution.

for ocamlbuild and ocamlfind user::

    `make`

for a classical compilation procedure::

    `make classic`

== How to use

Once you get an executable file you should download the following wkipedia
dump files:
XXXwiki-<YYYYMMDD>-page.sql.gz
XXXwiki-<YYYYMMDD>-pagelinks.sql.gz
+
where XXX is the nature of the dump (language, wikimedia, etc).
+
For first experiences it is recommended to use `simplewiki` dumps.

   `wikiscanner XXXwiki-<YYYYMMDD>-page.sql XXXwiki-<YYYYMMDD>-pagelinks.sql`
